# workaround-upstart-snafu
#
# When lied to about the behavior of a job’s main process wrt. forking with the
# “expect” stanza, Upstart can get into a confused state where it’s tracking a
# nonexistent pid.
#
# This hack creates new short-lived processes until one gets the pid in
# question, then has its parent die so that it’s going to get reaped by pid 1
# (Upstart), which will get Upstart out of the confused state.
#
# When “status <jobname>” says “<jobname> stop/killed, process 12345” and
# there’s no such process, run “workaround-upstart-snafu 12345” and wait until
# it exits.
